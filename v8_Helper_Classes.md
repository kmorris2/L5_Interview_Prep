## Helper Classes Tech interview 

We have v7 helper classes written in Sass
Our v8 helper classes are written in CSS
We wanted to write the helper class file in css modules but it posed too many changes at the global level, so we settled for CSS


- **CSS** is native, runs in the browser, and has gained many features that used to require Sass (nesting, custom properties, cascade layers, container queries). **Run-time**
- **Sass (SCSS syntax)** is a **compile-time**  language that adds variables, nesting, mixins/functions, math, and module tooling (@use/@forward). It‚Äôs great for authoring ergonomics and DRYness‚Äîbut everything is compiled down to plain CSS before the browser sees it.
With CSS Modules, both .module.css and .module.scss scope class names locally. The key differences become: authoring ergonomics (Sass) vs runtime theming + native features (modern CSS).

### Pros & cons (in practice)
**Sass (SCSS)**

**Pros**
* Ergonomic authoring: mixins/functions/loops reduce repetition.
* Clean module system (@use) to share design utilities.
* Powerful compile-time math & color transforms.
* Works great inside .module.scss‚Äîkeeps files tidy.
* 
**Cons**
* Extra build step, dependency on a compiler (Dart Sass).
* Variables are not themeable at runtime; you need CSS custom properties for live theming/dark mode.
* Over-nesting and @extend can create brittle specificity/output if misused.
* Increasing overlap with native CSS reduces the need for Sass in many codebases.

  
**Plain CSS**
  
**Pros**
* Zero compile layer; what you write is what ships.
* Runtime theming via custom properties; excellent with CSS Modules.
* New features cover many historical Sass use-cases (nesting, layers, container queries).
* Simpler toolchain and faster builds.
  
**Cons**
* No loops/conditionals/mixins; repetitive patterns can get verbose.
* Some authoring conveniences (math, color functions breadth) still feel nicer in Sass.
* Sharing ‚Äúutilities‚Äù across files is less structured than Sass‚Äôs @use (though design tokens via CSS vars help).



High-Level Differences: CSS vs Sass for Helper Classes
|Feature	|CSS Modules (.module.css)|	Sass (.scss)|
|---|---|---|
|Variables|	Uses native CSS variables (--token) or imported ones via @import|	Uses Sass variables ($var) with preprocessing|
|Nesting & Mixins|	‚ùå No native support (though PostCSS can help)|	‚úÖ Built-in via nesting and mixins
|Loops & Maps|	‚ùå Not supported|	‚úÖ Powerful loops (@each) and maps|
|Type Safety in TS|	‚úÖ Works out of the box with *.module.css.d.ts|	‚ùå Manual effort or custom typings|
|Toolchain Simplicity|	‚úÖ Just needs PostCSS + CSS loader|	‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Sass loader/configuration|
|Interoperability with TS|	‚úÖ Easy to import like a JS object|	‚ö†Ô∏è Not naturally module-scoped without naming conventions|
|Scoping|	‚úÖ Automatic with CSS Modules|	‚ùå Global unless manually scoped or using BEM-like convention|
|Design Token Support|	‚úÖ Native CSS var import (@import url(...))|	‚úÖ Works via Sass variables or custom maps|




‚öôÔ∏è Key Differences: CSS Modules vs Helper Classes
|Feature|	CSS Modules	Global| Helper Classes (your .css)|
|---|---|---|
|Scope|	Local per component|	Global (available app-wide)|
|Use case|	Component-specific styles|	Reusable layout/utility/spacing helpers|
|Naming|	Scoped via hashing (.Button_xyz)|	Prefixed manually (.hc-ml-1x, etc.)|
|Import usage|	`import styles from './file.module.css'`|	`import './_helper-classes.css'` (or once globally)|
|Class reference|	styles['foo']|	className="hc-ml-1x"|
|Tree-shaking|	Fully tree-shakable if unused|	Not tree-shakable unless purged|
|CSS strategy|	Encapsulation|	Atomic utility styling|




üîç Why Move Helper Classes from Sass to Plain .css

‚úÖ Benefits
|Benefit|	Explanation|
|---|---|
|Simplicity|	You‚Äôve removed the need for SASS build tooling (like sass-loader) and now just rely on native CSS ‚Äî easier to manage, debug, and onboard new contributors.|
|Better token management|	With @import of token .css files, you now get design tokens from a source-of-truth instead of relying on variable maps in SCSS.|
|Cross-platform compatibility	|Your CSS files can be used in environments where SASS isn‚Äôt supported (like web components or design token automation).|
|Easier testing / snapshotting|	Flat CSS maps more predictably to DOM snapshots and Percy regression diffs.|
|Separation of concerns|	You now clearly separate layout utilities (global CSS) from component styles (CSS Modules).|




‚ùå Tradeoffs / Challenges
|Limitation|	Workaround|
|---|---|
|No SASS features like loops or nesting|	Write classes manually or use a CSS preprocessor step like PostCSS with postcss-nested or @apply.|
|Harder to scale without SASS logic|	You might need to script or generate future helpers via codemods or build-time token transforms.|
|Global namespace risk|	You're handling this well with .hc-* prefixing, which mitigates collisions.|
|No dynamic class generation|	Whereas SASS allowed loops for spacing, now you'd have to write (or generate) every spacing class individually.|



### ü§î Why Not Use CSS Modules for Helper Classes?
You made the right decision not to use CSS Modules for helper classes ‚Äî here's why:
‚ùå **If You Used .module.css:**
* You'd have to import the CSS module (import styles from './_helper-classes.module.css') into every single component.
* You‚Äôd also need to map every class usage like: className={styles['hc-ml-1x']}, which gets repetitive.
* Worse, those class names would be hashed (like .hc-ml-1x_xyz123), making it harder to write global styles, debug snapshots, or apply styles conditionally.
* Percy + Cypress tests would become messier because class names would be obfuscated.




**Theming with Native CSS Variables**
You're importing:

`@import url('@design-systems/formatted-tokens/...');`
This makes your helpers **directly connected to tokens** from your theme, without needing to precompile or map $vars ‚Üí --tokens.
This enables:
* Theme overrides (light/dark) at runtime
* Easier custom theming downstream (for consumers)
* Less custom Sass tooling to manage tokens

### 4. Simplified Build Tooling
By using .css + native variables + CSS Modules:
* You avoid needing to bundle/configure sass-loader
* You stay closer to platform-native CSS (future-proofing)
